Hey everyone! I know I haven't posted much this year :(

I do have quite a few new things coming soon though!

- Dell shenanigans
- Flatbed scanner stuff
- Allwinner V3/V3S action cameras
- DJI Osmo Mobile SE

But that's coming soon:tm:

This blog post is about the new features! Yep, finally, we now have:

- A real comments system (not utterances), you can sign in with JoshAtticusID, Google or GitHub
- View count for posts
- Share count for posts

Views are based on requests to a specific page and use your IP address and cookies to determine if you're a unique viewer or not, shares are the same but check if your user agent is a social media crawler.

Anyways, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
