You've probably already seen it if you're here from the home page (if not check out the awesome new home page), but this is the new JoshAtticus Blog! I plan on continuing to post more frequently here & make various improvements in the future such as moving search, tags, comments, pagination etc to a server, *possibly* (**not** confirmed yet) adding a few non-intrusive ads to make a little bit of money from my content, and I also need to fix up mobile support.

The new blog ads a few new things

- Completely redesigned home page & blog page

- Search & Tags for posts

- Sharing to X/Twitter, Facebook and Email (more coming soon, leave suggestions in the comments)

- A cool little progress indicator at the top of the page that moves as you scroll down

The layout on mobile devices is a little bit janky but it's usable, it'll be fixed soon.

I hope you all like the new blog! If you have any questions or suggestions ask them in the comments at the bottom of the page :D
